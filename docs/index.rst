dinero - payment processing for Python
--------------------------------------

Dinero is library for Python that provides a clean minimal interface for
payment processing.  It provides a centralized, Pythonic interface for payments
and customer information management that is gateway-agnostic so you don't have
to learn each one in depth and can focus on getting the more interesting stuff
done.
